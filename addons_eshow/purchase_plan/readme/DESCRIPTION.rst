You use this module if you wish to give notification of requirements of
materials and/or external services and keep track of such requirements.

Plans can be created either directly or indirectly.
"Directly" means that someone from the requesting department enters a purchase
plan manually.

The person creating the plan determines what and how much to order,
and the requested date.

"Indirectly" means that the purchase plan initiated by the application
automatically, for example, from procurement orders (MO, SO).

A purchase pian is an instruction to Purchasing to procure a certain
quantity of materials services, so that they are available at a
certain point in time.

The plan contains the quantity and requested date of the
material to be supplied or the quantity of the service to be performed. You
can indicate the service specifications if needed.

Select the lines that you wish to initiate the RFQ for, then go to 'More'
and press 'Create RFQ'.

You can choose to select an existing RFQ or create a new one. In the later,
you have to choose a supplier.

In case that you chose to select an existing RFQ, the application will search
for existing lines matching the request line, and will add the extra
quantity to them, recalculating the minimum order quantity,
if it exists for the supplier of that RFQ.

In case that you create a new RFQ, the plan will also be
consolidated into as few as possible lines in the RFQ.
